  1-Add movies to your watchilst
  
  2-Get a random movie from the list (then, if you are going to watch it, it will get removed from that list and will be automatically listed in the "Watched" list).
  
  3-Format the content of the list, in case you want to import them from other apps
  
  
  
  COMING SOON:
